## Introduction

The objective of this project is to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on several medical attributes. We will use various machine learning models and techniques to achieve this goal.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease dataset, which contains several medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and others.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using the following command:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-classification.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd heart-disease-classification
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
    ```
    jupyter notebook end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb
    ```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The goal of EDA is to understand the dataset, identify patterns, detect outliers, and gain insights. We will explore the dataset by answering questions like:
- What kind of data do we have?
- What are the types of attributes?
- What's missing from the data?
- Are there any outliers?

## Modeling

We will use the following models to predict heart disease:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest

The models will be evaluated using various metrics, and hyperparameter tuning will be performed to improve their performance.

## Evaluation

We will evaluate the models using the following metrics:

- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
- ROC Curve and AUC

## Feature Importance

Feature importance helps in understanding which features contribute the most to the prediction. We will determine the feature importance for our Logistic Regression model and visualize it.

## Saving the Model

The trained model will be saved using the `pickle` library, allowing us to reuse the model for future predictions.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates an end-to-end approach to building a heart disease classification model. By following the steps outlined in the notebook, you will gain insights into the data, build and evaluate machine learning models, and understand the importance of different features in predicting heart disease.
